# Cancer Prediction

## _Overview_

Lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers account for approximately 45% of cancer-related deaths. Early detection is crucial in improving survival rates, as it allows for timely and potentially life-saving interventions. While traditional statistical methods are often employed to classify cancer risks (high risk or low risk), they can struggle with the complexity of high-dimensional data.

## _Objective_

>This project leverages machine learning techniques to address the limitations of traditional statistical methods in cancer prediction. By applying advanced algorithms, we aim to improve the accuracy of predicting cancer risks, ultimately contributing to early detection and better patient outcomes.

## _Algorithms Used_

The following machine learning algorithms have been implemented in this project:

- *Naive Bayes*: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions.
- *Decision Tree*: A model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences.
- *k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)*: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority label of their nearest neighbors.
- *k-Means Clustering*: A method of vector quantization that aims to partition data into k clusters in which each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
- *Random Forest Classifier*: An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes for classification tasks.

## _Conclusion_

By utilizing these machine learning algorithms, the project aims to provide a robust framework for predicting cancer risks, potentially aiding in the early detection and treatment of lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers.
